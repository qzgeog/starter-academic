I built dynamic and spatially explicit Agent-based models (ABMS), which are increasingly used in research to better understand coupled human-nature systems, in particular feedback relationships among social agents and between social agents and environmental dynamics. As a bottom-up approach, ABMs simulate heterogeneous social agents with multilevel interactions in a holistic system, involving various characteristics such as self-organization, non-linearity, adaptation, learning, and time lags.

ABMs have the flexibility to integrate with GIS data and platforms, which enables the establishment of spatial linkages among SES subsystems and spatially-explicit exploration of interactions among them. Importantly, human decision-making processes are key components in ABMs, and will be critical for addressing human dimensions.

Complexity theory and the core features of complex systems support the theoretical fundamentals of agent-based models (ABMs). ABMs are built by invoking the mainstream of aggregate complexity (the other two are algorithmic complexity and deterministic complexity), which focuses on how a complex system as a holistic substance at a higher level emerges from multiscale interactions among local entities at the lower level. 

A core characteristic related to emergence is self-organization, meaning that the rather strong yet sufficiently flexible relationships among agents can adapt the complex system to environmental change. The idea of complex adaptive systems evolves with prototypical examples of ecosystems that encompass the complex interactions within coupled natural and human systems, also known as biocomplexity. Studies on such complex systems emphasize the important role of social agents in the human system. Social agents mainly including people can learn from and adapt to environmental change, resulting in nonlinear system dynamics with distinct features such as feedback loops, resilience, and heterogeneity.

Interdisciplinary studies of coupled human-natural systems leverage ABMs to advance understanding of system complexity and address the causes and consequences of environmental dynamics. The efforts are often approached from the view of land use/cover change, or LUCC. Human decision-making processes is a key component for land use simulation with ABMs, or LUCC-ABMs. Thus, the development of such ABMs should incorporate theories from multiple disciplines (e.g., social science) that can explain human agentsâ€™ behavior and interactions.
