Prof. Chong Liu applies remote sensing techniques to map and monitor the Earth's terrestrial surfaces.
He develops remote sensing algorithms that are generalizable to applications from local to global scales. 
Liu obtained a Ph.D. Degree in remote sensing from a joint research program hosted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Wuhan University.
While staying at Chapel Hill, he conducted research in [Prof. Conghe Song's group](https://csong.web.unc.edu/dr-chong-liu/) in the Department of Geography. 
Fetured research publications include 
  - [Detecting impervious surface occurence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719301762)
  - [Mapping global cropping intensity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0034425720304685)
