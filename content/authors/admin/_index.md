I am a geographer with research interests in coupled human and natural systems, land use change, forest conservation, and household livelihoods. I use spatial data such as satellite observations and socioeconomic data collected from households surveys to examine when, where, how and why land use and land cover change. I integrate statistical models, agent-based models, remote sensing algorithms and machine learning techniques to answer questions that address the most urgent needs towards achieving sustainability goals such as ecosystem conservation and food security.
