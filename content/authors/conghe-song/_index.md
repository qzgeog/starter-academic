Prof. [Conghe Song](https://csong.web.unc.edu/) is a full professor in the [Department of Geography](https://geography.unc.edu/)
and a faculty fellow in the [Carolina Population Center](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/people/fellows/conghe-song/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
He conducts research with remotely sensed data, household surveys, and ecological models
to understand how land surface is changing, why it is changing and what the associated social-ecological consequences of these changes are. 

<br>

His recent research publications on coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) include:
- [Labor migration and forest dynamics under payments for ecosystem services](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2020.101167)
