Background: Payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs compensate landholders to improve land stewardship. China implemented forest restoration and conservation policies that adopt the PES approach. The socio-economic and ecological effect is often confounded by the multi-scale interactions operating within the complex system, known as the coupled human and natural system (CHANS). Two major PES programs of interest are:
- Converstion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP)
- Ecological Welfare Forest Program (EWFP)
<br>
<br>


Theme 1: Forest Dynamics
<br>

We establish three new remotely sensed forest development indices -- canopy closure index (CCI), maturity index (MI), and synergistic successional index (SSI) -- to monitor forest dynamics based on the Tasseled Cap transformation. 
<br>

{{< figure src="fig1_tc.png" title="Fig. 1. Canopy Closure Line (CCL) is defined based on canopy closure points in the brightnessâ€“greenness space of the tasseled cap transformation." >}} 
<br>

We employ multitemporal remote sensing analysis to infer the net effect of forest conservation policies in Tiantangzhai township, Anhui, China. Our results indicate that between 2002 and 2013, substantial land cover changes took place following the implementation of these two programs compared with the decade before. 
<br>

During 2002-2013, natural forests increased by 14%, while the area of cropland declined by 9%. This increase in total forest cover likewise resulted in a decline in landscape-wide fragmentation as natural forests received protection and new forest stands were established. CCFP forest stands are located in proximity to managing households and in favorable topographic positions experienced accelerated canopy structural development.

<br>
<br>


Theme 2: Cropland Abandonment
<br>

Cropland abandonment has emerged as a common phenomenon in land use transitions, i.e., net forest gain. Ecologically, cropland abandonment and payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs can both facilitate the provision of ecosystem services through reforestation and forest regeneration. 
<br>

{{< figure src="fig2_abandon.JPG" title="Abandoned cropland parcels in rural China." >}}
<br>

Our findings indicate that: 
1) the overall cropland abandonment rates for the CCFP-participating households were lower than those for the non-participants in the years immediately after the implementation of the CCFP, but there was an acceleration of cropland abandonment by the CCFP participants afterwards, leading to the convergence of cropland abandonment rates between the two types of households.
2) Although CCFP payment did not have a long-term effect on cropland abandonment, a larger amount of EWFP payment significantly increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment. 
3) Land parcel biophysical characteristics that facilitated cropland abandonment include proximity to EWFP and CCFP forests, poor accessibility and unfavorable topographic positions, and
4) among household socioeconomic conditions, poor farm labor availability and high proportion of local off-farm income in total gross income increased the likelihood of cropland abandonment, while owning domestic animals decreased the likelihood of abandoning cropland.

<br>
<br>


Theme 3: Rural-to-Urban Migration
<br>

Labor loss is a major driver of land use decisions by households. We find that CCFP can stimulate rural-to-urban migration by freeing farm labor from land cultivation as it retires cropland in marginal areas for reforestation.

<br>
<br>


Theme 4: Rural Livelihoods
<br>

Positive socioeconomic outcomes of the programs are essential for the long-term success of eco-environment conservation. 
<br>

We examine income distribution and inequality of rural households under CCFP and EWFP in Tianma Nature Reserve after 12 years of program implementation. Results show that CCFP-participating households have higher income inequality than non-participants, while the EWFP does not have a significant effect. Local off-farm work and out-migration with remittances are the two principal income sources and both add to inequality. 
<br>

{{< figure src="fig4_lorenz.jpg" title="Lorenz curve for net agricultural and non-agricultural income" >}}
<br>

A regression-based decomposition of inequality shows that the CCFP indirectly alters livelihoods by increasing outmigration with remittances, but it also adds to inequality from shifting livelihoods to non-agricultural activities. Meanwhile, EWFP payments positively affect agricultural incomes and contribute 16% to agricultural income inequality. Finally, human capital, natural capital and physical capital all play important roles in generating income and inequality, but the factors affecting inequality from agricultural and non-agricultural activities are different.
