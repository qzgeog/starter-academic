Global waste paper trade not only addresses resource scarcity issues, alleviates environmental pressures and brings substantial economic gains, but also contributes to the development of global circular economy. 
<br>

Here, we construct global waste paper trade networks (GWPTNs) during 2000â€“2018, and examine their structural evolution and determinants.
- Continent: Asia is the leading recipient of global waste paper, while Europe and North America are the main exporters.
- Economy: China and India dominate the waste paper import markets while the U.S. is the largest exporter; Germany is important in both importing and exporting hubs.
- Determinants: urbanization, GDP, environmental regulation, sharing language or religion, culture & historical relationships
