During 1994-2003, the Hangzhou metropolitan region (Zhejiang, Southeastern China) has witnessed accelerated urbanization, which was characterized by increases in total population, proportion of non-agriculture population, per capita GDP, and impervious surface area. 

Here, we perofmed multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of agricultural landscapes under urbanization based on Landsat satellite imagies.

We show that agricultural landscapes in this region were converted, fragmented, and isolated, reflected by decreaed total area, increased patch density, and lengthened Euclidean nearest neighbor distance.
